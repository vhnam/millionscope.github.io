**Prompt Engineering**, also known as **In-Context Prompting**, refers to methods for how to communicate with LLM to steer its behavior for desired outcomes _without_ updating the model weights. It is an empirical science and the effect of prompt engineering methods can vary a lot among models, thus requiring heavy experimentation and heuristics.

This post only focuses on prompt engineering for autoregressive language models, so nothing with Cloze tests, image generation or multimodality models. At its core, the goal of prompt engineering is about alignment and model steerability. Check my [previous post](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2021-01-02-controllable-text-generation/) on controllable text generation.

\[My personal spicy take\] In my opinion, some prompt engineering papers are not worthy 8 pages long, since those tricks can be explained in one or a few sentences and the rest is all about benchmarking. An easy-to-use and shared benchmark infrastructure should be more beneficial to the community. Iterative prompting or external tool use would not be trivial to set up. Also non-trivial to align the whole research community to adopt it.

# Basic Prompting[#](#basic-prompting)

Zero-shot and few-shot learning are two most basic approaches for prompting the model, pioneered by many LLM papers and commonly used for benchmarking LLM performance.

## Zero-Shot[#](#zero-shot)

**Zero-shot learning** is to simply feed the task text to the model and ask for results.

(All the sentiment analysis examples are from SST-2)

## Few-shot[#](#few-shot)

**Few-shot learning** presents a set of high-quality demonstrations, each consisting of both input and desired output, on the target task. As the model first sees good examples, it can better understand human intention and criteria for what kinds of answers are wanted. Therefore, few-shot learning often leads to better performance than zero-shot. However, it comes at the cost of more token consumption and may hit the context length limit when input and output text are long.

    Text: (lawrence bounces) all over the stage, dancing, running, sweating, mopping his face and generally displaying the wacky talent that brought him fame in the first place.
    Sentiment: positive

    Text: despite all evidence to the contrary, this clunker has somehow managed to pose as an actual feature movie, the kind that charges full admission and gets hyped on tv and purports to amuse small children and ostensible adults.
    Sentiment: negative

    Text: for the first time in years, de niro digs deep emotionally, perhaps because he's been stirred by the powerful work of his co-stars.
    Sentiment: positive

Many studies looked into how to construct in-context examples to maximize the performance and observed that **choice of prompt format, training examples, and the order of the examples can lead to dramatically different performance**, from near random guess to near SoTA.

[Zhao et al. (2021)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.09690) investigated the case of few-shot classification and proposed that several biases with LLM (they use GPT-3 in the experiments) contribute to such high variance: (1) _Majority label bias_ exists if distribution of labels among the examples is unbalanced; (2) _Recency bias_ refers to the tendency where the model may repeat the label at the end; (3) _Common token bias_ indicates that LLM tends to produce common tokens more often than rare tokens. To conquer such bias, they proposed a method to calibrate the label probabilities output by the model to be uniform when the input string is `N/A`.

### Tips for Example Selection[#](#tips-for-example-selection)

- Choose examples that are semantically similar to the test example using $k$-NN clustering in the embedding space ([Liu et al., 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.06804))
- To select a diverse and representative set of examples, [Su et al. (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01975) proposed to use a graph-based approach:

        - (1) First, construct a directed graph $G=(V, E)$ based on the embedding (e.g. by [SBERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.10084) or [other](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.10005) [embedding](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings) [models](https://openai.com/blog/new-and-improved-embedding-model)) cosine similarity between samples, where each node points to its $k$ nearest neighbors;

        - (2) Start with a set of selected samples $\mathcal{L}=\emptyset$ and a set of remaining samples $\mathcal{U}$.
        Each sample $u \in \mathcal{U}$ is scored by 
        
        $$\text{score}(u) = \sum_{v \in \{v \mid (u, v) \in E, v\in \mathcal{U}\}} s(v)\quad\text{where }s(v)=\rho^{- \vert \{\ell \in \mathcal{L} \vert (v, \ell)\in E \}\vert},\quad\rho > 1 $$

        such that $s(v)$ is low if many of $v$'s neighbors are selected and thus the scoring encourages to pick diverse samples.

- [Rubin et al. (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.08633) proposed to train embeddings via [contrastive learning](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2021-05-31-contrastive/) specific to one training dataset for in-context learning sample selection. Given each training pair $(x, y)$, the quality of one example $e\_i$ (formatted input-output pair) can be measured by a conditioned probability assigned by LM: $\text{score}(e\_i) = P\_\text{LM}(y \mid e\_i, x)$. We can identify other examples with top-$k$ and bottom-$k$ scores as positive and negative sets of candidates for every training pair and use that for contrastive learning.
- Some researchers tried [Q-Learning](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2018-02-19-rl-overview/#q-learning-off-policy-td-control) to do sample selection. ([Zhang et al. 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04486))
- Motivated by uncertainty-based [active learning](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2022-02-20-active-learning/), [Diao et al. (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12246) suggested to identify examples with high disagreement or entropy among multiple sampling trials. Then annotate these examples to be used in few-shot prompts.

### Tips for Example Ordering[#](#tips-for-example-ordering)

- A general suggestion is to keep the selection of examples diverse, relevant to the test sample and in random order to avoid majority label bias and recency bias.
- Increasing model sizes or including more training examples does not reduce variance among different permutations of in-context examples. Same order may work well for one model but badly for another. When the validation set is limited, consider choosing the order such that the model does not produce extremely unbalanced predictions or being overconfident about its predictions. ([Lu et al. 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.08786))

# Instruction Prompting[#](#instruction-prompting)

The purpose of presenting few-shot examples in the prompt is to explain our intent to the model; in other words, describe the task instruction to the model in the form of demonstrations. However, few-shot can be expensive in terms of token usage and restricts the input length due to limited context length. So, why not just give the instruction directly?

_Instructed LM_ (e.g. [InstructGPT](https://openai.com/research/instruction-following), [natural instruction](https://github.com/allenai/natural-instructions)) finetunes a pretrained model with high-quality tuples of (task instruction, input, ground truth output) to make LM better understand user intention and follow instruction. [RLHF](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2021-01-02-controllable-text-generation/#rl-fine-tuning-with-human-preferences) (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) is a common method to do so. The benefit of instruction following style fine-tuning improves the model to be more aligned with human intention and greatly reduces the cost of communication.

When interacting with instruction models, we should describe the task requirement in details, trying to be _specific_ and _precise_ and avoiding say “not do something” but rather specify what to do.

    Please label the sentiment towards the movie of the given movie review. The sentiment label should be "positive" or "negative".

Explaining the desired audience is another smart way to give instructions

- For example to produce education materials for kids,

  Describe what is quantum physics to a 6-year-old.

- And safe content,

  ... in language that is safe for work.

_In-context instruction learning_ ([Ye et al. 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14691)) combines few-shot learning with instruction prompting. It incorporates multiple demonstration examples across different tasks in the prompt, each demonstration consisting of instruction, task input and output. Note that their experiments were only on classification tasks and the instruction prompt contains all label options.

    Definition: Determine the speaker of the dialogue, "agent" or "customer".
    Input: I have successfully booked your tickets.
    Ouput: agent

    Definition: Determine which category the question asks for, "Quantity" or "Location".
    Input: What's the oldest building in US?
    Ouput: Location

    Definition: Classify the sentiment of the given movie review, "positive" or "negative".
    Input: i'll bet the video game is a lot more fun than the film.

# Self-Consistency Sampling[#](#self-consistency-sampling)

**Self-consistency sampling** ([Wang et al. 2022a](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.11171)) is to sample multiple outputs with temperature > 0 and then selecting the best one out of these candidates. The criteria for selecting the best candidate can vary from task to task. A general solution is to pick **majority vote**. For tasks that are easy to validate such as a programming question with unit tests, we can simply run through the interpreter and verify the correctness with unit tests.

# Chain-of-Thought (CoT)[#](#chain-of-thought-cot)

**Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting** ([Wei et al. 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903)) generates a sequence of short sentences to describe reasoning logics step by step, known as _reasoning chains_ or _rationales_, to eventually lead to the final answer. The benefit of CoT is more pronounced for **complicated reasoning tasks**, while using **large models** (e.g. with more than 50B parameters). Simple tasks only benefit slightly from CoT prompting.
